            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Is Brawl Mystery officially made by Supercell? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">No. Brawl Mystery is an unofficial fan project with no affiliation to Supercell Oy. Brawl Stars™ is a registered trademark of Supercell. Use is covered under the Supercell Fan Content Policy.</div>

            <h2>Rules &amp; Limits</h2>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">How many times can I play per day? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">Each of the 4 modes can be played up to <strong>2 times per day</strong>. After using all attempts, there's a 12-hour cooldown before new games unlock.</div>
            </div>

                <div class="faq-a">You get <strong>8 guesses</strong> per mode. Each wrong guess reveals more clues – the image gets clearer in Pixel Mode, more emojis appear in Emoji Mode, and more words show up in Description Mode.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Do the Brawlers change every day? <span>▾</span></div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Can the same Brawler appear in multiple modes on the same day? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">Yes, it's possible. The daily Brawlers are selected independently per mode, so the same Brawler can appear as the mystery in more than one mode on the same day.</div>
            </div>

            <h2>The 4 Game Modes</h2>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Which mode is best for beginners? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a"><strong>Classic Mode</strong> is ideal for beginners. The comparison table gives you clear feedback after every guess – whether the target Brawler's values are higher or lower than yours – so you can narrow it down systematically.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">What does ↑ or ↓ mean in Classic Mode? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a"><strong>↑</strong> means the target Brawler has a HIGHER value than your guess. <strong>↓</strong> means it's LOWER. A green cell means that attribute is an exact match!</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Which mode is the hardest? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a"><strong>Description Mode</strong> is the toughest – only a handful of words from the official character description are shown at first. It rewards players with deep knowledge of Brawl Stars lore.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Where do the emojis in Emoji Mode come from? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">The emojis are hand-picked to reference the Brawler's weapon, personality, appearance or backstory. They're not taken directly from the game but chosen specifically for Brawl Mystery.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Where do the character descriptions come from? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">The texts are the official character descriptions from Brawl Stars. The more you know about Brawler lore and backstories, the faster you'll recognize them in Description Mode.</div>
            </div>

            <h2>Brawlers &amp; Content</h2>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Which Brawlers are included? <span>▾</span></div>

                <div class="faq-q">Is the Brawler Library updated when new Brawlers are released? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">Yes! The <a href="library.html">Brawler Library</a> and the game are updated regularly when Supercell adds new Brawlers to Brawl Stars. New Brawlers are then added to the daily quiz pool as well.</div>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item" onclick="this.classList.toggle('open')">
                <div class="faq-q">Any tips for finding the right Brawler faster? <span>▾</span></div>
                <div class="faq-a">In Classic Mode, start with a mid-rarity Brawler (e.g. Epic) and use the arrows as a binary search. In Pixel Mode, focus on color schemes and silhouettes. In Emoji Mode, memorize common emoji combinations for well-known Brawlers. Find the full strategy guide <a href="guide.html">here</a>.</div>
            </div>
